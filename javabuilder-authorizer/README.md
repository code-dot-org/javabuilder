# Javabuilder Authorizer

This lambda function is an 
[API Gateway Authorizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api-lambda-auth.html).
It expects a JWT token to be sent in an Authorization header in the standard format 
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

You must be running ruby version 2.7.2 for the upload to work properly. The lambda 
expects the gems to be in `vendor\bundle\ruby\2.7.0\*`. You may be able to manually
rename the `2.7.0` folder to workaround installing a different ruby version.

## Testing
To run unit tests, run `rake test` from this folder. For end to end testing, refer to the main [README](../README.MD).
