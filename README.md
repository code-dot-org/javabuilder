# Prerequisites
You need to install Ruby 2.7.4 to build and/or run the Ruby lambda functions (`javabuilder-authorizer` and `api-gateway-routes`).
[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) is a useful tool for installing Ruby 
and managing multiple versions. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installing-ruby-versions) to
use rbenv to install a new Ruby version. You may need to also install [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build#readme) to get the latest Ruby
versions. The `.ruby-version` file sets the local Ruby version for javabuilder to be 2.7.4.
