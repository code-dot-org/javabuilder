Description: Javabulder CI/CD dependencies
    
Resources:

  # The Artifact Store holds artifacts from codebuild/pipeline so they can be passed
  # from one stage of a pipeline to the next, or so artifacts can be reviewed.
  # We use a single bucket, though multiple instances of the pipeline may exist.
  ArtifactStore:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket

  # This role will be used by CodeBuild to execute the CI build. Here we have
  # the common policy rules required. Since we may want to create multiple
  # codebuild projects for different branches, we can append policies when those
  # stack resources are created (in "2-cicd")
